<h2>Urban Platforms – QA Engineering Projects</h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
Multiple web, mobile, and backend systems with complex user flows, pricing logic,
and evolving requirements created risks of UX issues, incorrect calculations,
API failures, and undetected regressions.
</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Executed manual regression, usability, and cross-browser testing for ride-reservation and food-delivery applications.</li>
  <li>Clarified ambiguous requirements using mind maps, flow diagrams, and equivalence partitioning.</li>
  <li>Designed and executed API tests with Postman for kits, delivery availability, and pricing rules.</li>
  <li>Automated backend and UI test suites using Python, Pytest, and Selenium with Page Object Model.</li>
  <li>Investigated production issues using Linux log analysis and PostgreSQL queries.</li>
  <li>Documented defects and results in Jira and GitHub with structured READMEs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Result</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Detected critical issues before release across UI, API, and data layers.</li>
  <li>Reduced regression risk through automated test coverage.</li>
  <li>Improved requirement clarity and defect prioritization.</li>
  <li>Increased confidence in system stability and release readiness.</li>
</ul>
