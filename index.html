    <h3>Urban Routes – Web & API Testing</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Context:</strong><br>
      Urban Routes is a web-based transportation platform designed to allow users
      to request rides, calculate routes, and manage trip details in real time.
      The objective of this project was to validate the functional stability,
      usability, and data integrity of the application before release.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Analysis:</strong><br>
      I performed end-to-end manual testing of core user flows, including 
      route calculation, pricing logic, and ride requests.
      API testing was conducted using Postman to validate request/response
      structures, HTTP status codes, and error handling. I also executed
      boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning to ensure input
      validation and system robustness.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Conclusions:</strong><br>
      The testing process identified several UI inconsistencies and API validation
      issues related to incorrect status codes and missing error messages.
      These findings helped improve system reliability and enhanced the overall
      user experience. This project strengthened my skills in functional testing,
      API validation, and defect reporting.

    <h3>Urban Grocers – Data Validation & Backend Testing</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Context:</strong><br>
      Urban Grocers is an online grocery delivery platform that processes customer
      orders, inventory data, and delivery schedules. The goal of this project
      was to ensure data accuracy across the backend systems and verify that
      business rules were correctly implemented.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Analysis:</strong><br>
      I validated backend data using SQL endpoints to compare database records
      against expected business logic. API testing was performed to confirm
      correct data transmission between services. I also analyzed production-like
      datasets to identify inconsistencies, missing values, and incorrect
      calculations that could impact order fulfillment.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Conclusions:</strong><br>
      The project revealed multiple data integrity issues that could have resulted
      in incorrect order totals and inventory mismatches. By documenting these
      findings and proposing validation improvements, system accuracy and
      reliability were significantly improved. This project reinforced my
      experience in backend testing, data analysis, and SQL-based validation.
